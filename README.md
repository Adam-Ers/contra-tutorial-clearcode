# contra-tutorial-clearcode
Contra Tutorial from Clearcode's udemy series, but with many additions that I managed to add without using tutorials or googling solutions.

To play, simply download the repository, and either run the .bat, or run main.py. Settings can be configured in settings.py in the code folder.

Requires Python 3.10 or later, and the latest versions of pygame and pytmx (the batch file will check for both, and install them if needed).

Default controls: 

Left and Right Arrows - Movement

Down Arrow - Duck

Z - Jump/Respawn

X - Fire

C - Dash

Shift - Strafe

K - Self-Destruct

F - Fullscreen

P - Show Framerate
